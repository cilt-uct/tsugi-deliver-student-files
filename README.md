# Student Files

Site owners and lecturers can upload files to the site and students will then gain access to particular files that contain their student number in the filename.

This is a quick and easy way to deliver feedback, assignments and other focused file delivery to a specific student.

### Developement

The test site in tsugi can be cleaned periodically by running the following php script:

```
https://[site]/mod/tsugi-deliver-student-files/actions/clean-up.php

```
